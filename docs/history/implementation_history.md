## Why The Simplification Was Needed

The repository accumulated several valid but competing surfaces: the verified
single-agent runtime, MAS experiments, report-cache promotion work, evaluator
and benchmark tooling, compatibility projections, long handoff logs, and raw
experiment outputs. All of them were visible enough to look equally important.

The simplification goal was not to minimize line count. It was to make the
portfolio's core engineering argument obvious:

1. recover DART structure;
2. retrieve the right evidence;
3. let an LLM interpret intent and semantics;
4. execute arithmetic and binding deterministically;
5. preserve evidence and provenance in the public result.

Optional systems remain available, but they no longer define the default
product surface.

## Earlier Extraction Stop Lines

Before the final portfolio sequence, the repository had already extracted or
isolated several implementation owners:

- calculation planning, execution, rendering, and public projection helpers;
- parser structure recovery and vector-store ownership;
- MAS graph, node, type, and diagnostic facades under an experimental boundary;
- reviewer-only requirements, demos, gates, and operational commands;
- strict task-ledger and artifact projections for agentic workflows;
- runtime critic acceptance separated from offline evaluator scores.

Those extractions established clearer owners but did not by themselves make the
first-read product boundary obvious. The July 2026 PR sequence closed that gap.

## Portfolio Core Simplification Sequence

| PR | Merge commit | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #79 | `d88040f` | Refactored portfolio positioning around the single-agent core, fixed generic numeric provenance matching, and separated retrieval ownership without tuning behavior. |
| #80 | `33c756d` | Fixed canonical agent answer projection so public output is assembled from owned canonical contracts. |
| #81 | `db9d6e7` | Removed legacy top-level public calculation fallback while keeping historical replay compatibility explicit. |
| #82 | `511f1bd` | Made persisted `ReportCacheIndex` loading lazy and configuration-dependent. |
| #83 | `69082c6` | Closed the default import and invocation boundary against optional MAS, evaluator, benchmark, promotion, review, and cache-index implementations. |
| #84 | `294b4ea` | Reduced tracked benchmark output from 324 raw/intermediate files to 26 compact history-linked summaries and diagnostics. |

### July Milestone 1: Product And Correctness Boundary

The reviewer-facing entry point became `FinancialAgent.run()`. The repository
story was reordered around hybrid retrieval, semantic planning, deterministic
calculation, and provenance rather than experimental topology.

Two correctness gaps were closed with generic mechanisms:

- numeric evidence equivalence preserves sign;
- final-answer evidence selection uses value, label, period, and provenance
  compatibility instead of numeric equality plus list order.

No company, benchmark ID, or metric-specific runtime branch was added.

### July Milestone 2: Retrieval Ownership

Query construction, filters, vector/BM25 search, reranking, selection, and
`retrieval_debug_trace` moved behind the retrieval pipeline owner. Structure
expansion and evidence construction remain owned by the graph/evidence layer.

This was an ownership refactor, not a retrieval-tuning change, so it did not
require a benchmark refresh.

### July Milestone 3: Canonical Public Projection

The public response stopped reviving stale top-level `calculation_*` mirrors.
Canonical numeric output is expressed through `resolved_calculation_trace`,
explicit `structured_result`, and task/artifact projections.

Historical replay and retrospective tooling may request compatibility behavior
explicitly; default runtime code does not infer it.

This completed the July public-projection milestone. It did not complete the
broader Phase 3 calculation-path convergence defined in
`docs/architecture/core_runtime_surface_refactoring_plan.md`; that phase remains
open.

The first projection slice passed 79 focused router/projection/import tests and
1,350 full tests. The second passed the 216-literal runtime audit, 625 focused
calculation-projection tests, and 1,348 full tests. Both passed
`git diff --check`; neither required a benchmark refresh because retrieval and
calculation behavior were unchanged.

### July Milestone 4: Optional-System Isolation

The persisted report-cache implementation became lazy and configuration-bound.
Subprocess regression gates then verified both import and deterministic
invocation boundaries without API keys or network access.

The default path does not load optional MAS, evaluator, benchmark, promotion,
portfolio-review, or persisted cache-index implementations. Their focused tests
remain independently runnable.

### July Milestone 5: Review And Evidence Noise

Raw and intermediate benchmark output was removed from the published Git
surface unless a compact file is directly used by internal history. Future
`benchmarks/results/**` output is ignored by default; local stores, caches, and
heartbeat logs remain local-only.

The final documentation slice converted `CONTEXT.md` and
`docs/overview/project_status.md` from multi-thousand-line chronological logs
into current-state snapshots. This history file records the structural sequence,
while exact pre-compression text remains available in Git at `main@294b4ea`.

## Post-Stop-Line Calculation Contract Sequence

The 2026-08-07 through 2026-08-08 work resumed only for reproduced calculation,
precedence, and provenance gaps. Correctness fixes were committed separately
from behavior-preserving owner moves so validation evidence remains attributable.
This sequence advances the broader calculation-path Phase 3; it does not finish
that phase, prove a total-code reduction, or establish a broad performance gain.

### Dependency precedence and terminal finalization

- The earlier owner extraction changed `financial_graph_calculation.py` from
  21,642 to 19,682 lines while source as a whole grew by 1,095 lines. The typed
  main-path application then changed the graph from 19,686 to 19,587 lines while
  the two changed source files grew by 109 lines. These were ownership moves,
  not executed-policy removal.
- `b16a6c5` prevents consolidation- or producer-scope-rejected dependency rows
  from re-entering through the active late snapshot. The subsequent late-owner
  move changed the graph from 19,587 to 19,564 lines and the dependency owner
  from 2,656 to 2,760 lines, for a two-source net increase of 81 lines.
- `c6f6fdf` makes the normalized-unit filter terminal. `5b44875` moves that
  filter and no-filter selected-first/dependency-second preservation into a
  typed state-free finalizer. `8ebb239` separately repairs empty and partial
  post-filter coverage. From the `77d5bff` baseline, the bounded slice changes
  the graph by 12 lines and the owner by 73, for a two-source net increase of
  85 lines.

Validation remained separated: the earlier extraction passed 62 focused
operand/execution and 323 focused calculation/projection tests, the 217-literal
runtime audit, and full discovery over 1,451 tests; typed main application passed
76 focused, the same audit, and 1,457 full tests. `b16a6c5` passed 78 focused,
the same audit, and 1,457 full tests; the subsequent late-owner checkpoint passed
78 focused, the same audit, and 1,462 full tests. `c6f6fdf` passed 3 focused and
1,462 full tests, `5b44875` passed 52 focused and 1,468 full tests, and the
`8ebb239` state passed 53 focused and 1,468 full tests, each with the same audit.

### Stale freshness, candidate decomposition, and provenance

- `f0eafae` prevents repeated repair of a source-stated display whose formula
  trace still matches the operands. `2496fce` moves only its bound-operand
  freshness assessment to the execution owner. That structural checkpoint
  changes the graph from 19,591 to 19,558 lines and the execution owner from 614
  to 712, for a two-source net increase of 65 lines; from `73d593e`, the bounded
  slice is net 80 lines across those sources.
- `406c1ef` characterizes stale execution snapshots. `c2a5e96` then decomposes
  graph-private preparation, deterministic result projection, and state/ledger
  projection; stale repair stops recursively invoking `_execute_calculation()`.
  The graph changes from 19,558 to 19,730 lines. This is an internal seam, not an
  execution-owner move.
- `f2af4f4` makes the prepared canonical value the freshness authority: raw
  0.0035 is compared with canonical 3.5, and actual stale repair evaluates its
  formula once. The execution owner changes from 712 to 679 lines, the graph
  from 19,730 to 19,736, production source is net -27, and the whole source/test
  diff is net -83. It adds no ledger or selected-claim synchronization.
- `be2e7bf` synchronizes only accepted repair provenance at render,
  planning-capture, and aggregate caller boundaries. Production source is
  `+332/-50`, net 282, and the whole commit is `+792/-69`, net 723. Ambiguous
  refs remain preserved; this is not whole-ledger synchronization.
- `2cfa867` moves pure aggregate provenance selection and canonical operation
  family normalization to `financial_aggregate_projection.py`. The graph changes
  from 19,933 to 19,802 lines and the owner from 195 to 376; production source is
  `+197/-147`, net 50, and the whole commit is `+392/-184`, net 208. Repair
  acceptance, filtering order, and answer/state orchestration remain graph-owned.

The stale freshness checkpoint passed 29 focused tests, the 217-literal audit,
and 1,472 full tests. The `f2af4f4` state passed 345 unique focused tests plus
the same audit and 1,472 full tests. `be2e7bf` passed 560 affected tests, the
same audit, and 1,472 full tests; `2cfa867` passed 564 affected tests, the same
audit, and 1,476 full tests.

### Candidate recovery and deterministic planning

- `1a3979e` lets dependency and period contract-valid scalar recovery consume
  candidate operands, plan, and result without two discarded state/ledger
  projections. Source is `+36/-25`, net 11; tests are `+176/-57`, net 119; the
  whole commit is `+212/-82`, net 130. The primary projector remains intact.
- `af968a6` moves state-free difference/growth plan construction and typed
  raw/guarded selection to the execution owner. Production source is
  `+249/-118`, net 131; tests are `+182/-5`, net 177; the whole commit is
  `+431/-123`, net 308. Supported-path parity does not imply malformed-input
  evaluation- or exception-order parity.
- `ec93f8a` separately fixes percent-point policy evaluation against an
  incomplete plan. The graph is line-neutral at `+9/-9`; tests add 32 lines;
  the whole commit is `+41/-9`, net 32.

Validation progressed from 3 focused, 564 affected, the 217-literal audit, and
1,476 full tests after `1a3979e`, to 4 targeted, 107 focused owner/aggregate,
564 affected, the same audit, and 1,478 full tests after `af968a6`. After
`ec93f8a`, 4 targeted/adjacent, 29 execution-module, and 593 unique affected
tests passed with the same audit and 1,479 full tests.

### Dependency recalculation isolation and mode disposition

- `8296eb1` prevents stale parent `structured_result` or `subtask_results` from
  overriding the explicit dependency trace. It changes the dependency owner by
  2 lines, adds 63 test lines, and is net 65 overall.
- `ea84921` removes the synthetic recalculation state and raw-plan callback for
  supported scalar recovery. Existing executable plans build no raw plan;
  invalid or absent plans build one and pass it explicitly. The graph changes
  from 19,786 to 19,828 lines and the dependency owner from 2,835 to 2,796;
  production source is `+78/-75`, net 3, tests are `+167/-90`, net 77, and the
  whole commit is `+245/-165`, net 80. The full count moved from 1,480 to 1,479
  because the deleted synthetic helper's obsolete direct test was removed; this
  is not a regression claim.
- `d1114c6` adds the typed `rebuild`, `reuse`, and `unsupported_mode` dependency
  plan disposition. An executable non-`single_value` plan is unsupported and
  does not recalculate that row before raw-plan construction, candidate
  execution, or ratio formatting; the isolated no-change regression retains the
  original list/row identity. Existing scalar reuse and invalid/absent rebuild
  behavior remain unchanged. The graph changes from 19,828 to 19,831
  lines and the dependency owner from 2,796 to 2,813; source is `+22/-2`, net 20,
  tests add 46 lines, and the whole commit is `+68/-2`, net 66.

`8296eb1` passed 4 targeted tests, the 217-literal audit, and 1,480 full tests.
`ea84921` passed 3 targeted and 615 affected tests, the same audit, and 1,479
full tests. `d1114c6` passed 1 targeted and the same 615 affected tests, the same
audit, and 1,479 full tests on Python 3.13. No benchmark refresh ran for any of
these post-stop-line calculation changes.

### Required-candidate operand merge ownership

- `1f67638` moves the post-main required-candidate merge from the graph into the
  existing operand-resolution owner. The typed state-free result merges coherent
  rows into producer-scope-filtered candidates, evaluates required coverage, and
  applies complete-ratio candidate-first or otherwise current-first precedence.
  Candidate/evidence builders, producer-scope filtering, the lazy coherent-context
  builder gate, logging, and runtime projection remain graph-owned.
- The graph changes from 19,831 to 19,823 lines (`+12/-20`, net -8) and the
  operand owner from 1,770 to 1,854 lines (`+84`). Production source is
  `+96/-20`, net 76; tests are `+185/-15`, net 170; the whole commit is
  `+281/-35`, net 246.
- Validation passed 5/5 focused tests, 299/299 affected tests, the 217-literal
  runtime audit, and full discovery over 1,480/1,480 tests on Python 3.13.
  Benchmark refresh was NOT RUN.

This is a required-candidate precedence/merge ownership move, not a total-code,
executed-path, performance, private-mesh, or complete Phase 3 reduction claim.

### Direct structured operand acceptance ownership

- `25eeccb` moves the ordered direct structured-row acceptance stages from the
  graph into the existing operand-resolution owner. The typed state-free owner
  preserves required matching and surface validation, the first ambiguity gate,
  lookup direct-support filtering, the second lookup ambiguity gate, stable row
  order/identity, and no-stage list identity. The graph retains upstream
  row/evidence construction, coercion, consolidation-scope and target policy,
  the applicability gate, direct structured evidence preference/refinement,
  recovered context/evidence adoption, and runtime projection.
- The graph changes from 19,823 to 19,792 lines (`+14/-45`, net -31) and the
  operand owner from 1,854 to 1,953 lines (`+99`). Production source is
  `+113/-45`, net 68; tests are `+259/-10`, net 249; the whole commit is
  `+372/-55`, net 317. The extraction adapter's definition-to-next-definition
  span changes from 851 to 818 lines.
- Validation passed 7/7 targeted tests, 301/301 affected tests, the 217-literal
  runtime audit, and full discovery over 1,482/1,482 tests on Python 3.13.
  Benchmark refresh was NOT RUN.

This is a direct-acceptance ownership move, not a total-code, broad executed-path,
performance, private-mesh, end-to-end calculation-owner, or complete Phase 3
reduction claim.

### Recovered context adoption ownership

- `f1152b7` moves the duplicated state-free adoption bodies for graph-built
  period-comparison and coherent-ratio rows into the operand-resolution owner.
  The typed result preserves period recovered-first/current missing-fill versus
  coherent-ratio replacement, used-evidence filtering and order, existing-id
  exclusion, candidate duplicates, top-level row copies with nested identity,
  and no-context identity. The graph retains recovery eligibility,
  document/evidence collection, context-row builders, logging, the
  ratio-recovered flag, main precedence, and runtime projection.
- The graph changes from 19,792 to 19,776 lines (`+24/-40`, net -16) and the
  operand owner from 1,953 to 2,045 lines (`+92`). Production source is
  `+116/-40`, net 76; tests are `+263/-38`, net 225; the whole commit is
  `+379/-78`, net 301. The extraction adapter's definition-to-next-definition
  span changes from 818 to 800 lines.
- Validation passed 5/5 targeted tests, 355/355 affected tests, the 217-literal
  runtime audit, and full discovery over 1,483/1,483 tests on Python 3.13.
  Benchmark refresh was NOT RUN.

This is a recovered-row/evidence adoption ownership move, not a move of recovery
eligibility or context builders and not a total-code, broad executed-path,
performance, private-mesh, end-to-end calculation-owner, or complete Phase 3
reduction claim.

## Verification At The Stop Line

- Full unittest discovery: 1,350 passed at the Phase 5 stop line.
- Portfolio review gates: READY.
- Expanded structural numeric evidence: 9 / 9 PASS.
- Plain-retrieval diagnostic comparison: 5 / 9 PASS.
- Default import and invocation optional-boundary regressions: passing.
- Published benchmark evidence: 26 compact history-linked files.

These numbers are retained evidence, not a claim that docs-only changes rerun a
paid benchmark. Detailed methodology and run interpretation live in
[experiment_history.md](experiment_history.md) and
[../evaluation/benchmarking.md](../evaluation/benchmarking.md).

## Stop Line

The broad July portfolio-surface simplification is complete. The broader Phase 3
calculation-path convergence remains in progress. Future changes should start
from a concrete runtime regression, evidence-faithfulness problem, reviewer demo
gap, dependency change, or real compatibility caller.

Do not restart broad helper extraction, all-at-once test splitting, MAS feature
growth, cache serving, or fresh benchmark ingest solely to make the repository
look more active. Improve the reviewer path and representative demo before
adding scope.
