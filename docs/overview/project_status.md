## Product Boundary

The portfolio product is the single-agent `FinancialAgent` runtime for DART
filing analysis. Its reviewer-facing engineering story is:

1. preserve DART section and table structure during ingest;
2. retrieve with dense/BM25 hybrid search and structure-aware expansion;
3. use an LLM for intent and semantic planning;
4. bind operands and execute calculations deterministically;
5. return evidence-backed answers with calculation and provenance traces.

MAS, report-cache promotion, evaluators, benchmark runners, and extended review
workflows remain optional or experimental. They must not load during default
imports or an unconfigured `FinancialAgent` invocation.

## Current Source State

- PRs #79 through #84 completed the portfolio core simplification sequence on
  2026-07-22; PR #85 compressed the current-state and handoff documents.
- Latest confirmed merge: PR #85, `main@f0a5145`.
- Canonical public numeric contracts are `resolved_calculation_trace`, explicit
  `structured_result`, and task/artifact projections.
- Top-level `calculation_*` compatibility mirrors are not part of the default
  `FinancialAgent.run()` response.
- Default import and deterministic invocation regression gates cover isolation
  from MAS, evaluator, benchmark, promotion, portfolio-review, and persisted
  cache-index implementations.
- Tracked benchmark outputs were reduced from 324 raw/intermediate files to 26
  compact, history-linked summaries and diagnostics. Full result bundles,
  stores, caches, and heartbeat logs are local-only.

The Phase 5 completion change also removes chronological implementation diaries
from this current-state document and `CONTEXT.md`. Detailed pre-compression text
remains recoverable from `main@294b4ea`.

## Runtime Ownership

| Surface | Current owner |
| --- | --- |
| Public entry point | `FinancialAgent.run()` |
| DART parsing | `FinancialParser.process_document()` and parser modules |
| Canonical ingest profile | `src/config/runtime_contract.py` |
| Query/filter/search/rerank/selection trace | `financial_retrieval_pipeline.py` |
| Structure expansion and evidence construction | `financial_graph_evidence.py` |
| Semantic plan | LLM-backed planning contract |
| Operand binding and calculation | deterministic calculation runtime |
| Public calculation projection | `resolved_calculation_trace` and `structured_result` |
| Optional MAS | `src.experimental.mas` facade |
| Optional persisted report cache | configured `ReportCacheIndex` boundary |

Domain vocabulary belongs in ontology, retrieval policy, config, or documented
data artifacts. Runtime control flow implements generic mechanisms only.

## Current Gate Status

| Gate | Latest status |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime contract gate | PASS |
| Hard structural numeric gate | PASS, 5 / 5 |
| Concept runtime gap gate | PASS, 7 / 7 |
| Policy-driven runtime gate | PASS |
| Expanded structural numeric gate | PASS, 9 / 9 |
| Plain-retrieval comparison | 5 / 9 diagnostic baseline |
| Reflection promotion gate | READY |
| Report-cache promotion evidence | READY, serving disabled |
| Promotion trace materiality gate | READY |
| REFERENCE_NOTE capability gate | READY, Researcher context-only |
| Portfolio review gates | READY |
| Full unittest discovery | 1,352 passed after the final reviewer walkthrough |

The structural and plain numbers are retained portfolio evidence, not a claim
that every docs-only change reran a paid benchmark. Fresh benchmark work is
required only when parser, ingest, store signature, retrieval behavior, or a
material answer contract changes.

## Reviewer Evidence Surface

- Product and quick start: [README.md](../../README.md)
- Five-minute summary: [portfolio_one_pager.md](portfolio_one_pager.md)
- Experiment narrative: [portfolio_experiment_report.md](portfolio_experiment_report.md)
- Runtime architecture and stop lines:
  [core_runtime_surface_refactoring_plan.md](../architecture/core_runtime_surface_refactoring_plan.md)
- Benchmark operation and interpretation: [benchmarking.md](../evaluation/benchmarking.md)
- Detailed experiment chronology: [experiment_history.md](../history/experiment_history.md)
- Core simplification chronology: [implementation_history.md](../history/implementation_history.md)

Reviewer-facing claims should resolve through these documents and the compact
source-controlled fixtures they reference. Local `benchmarks/results/**` data is
not part of the published product surface.

## Active Blockers

There is no active correctness or architecture blocker in the verified
single-agent path. Optional MAS and cache-promotion work is intentionally
disabled or experimental rather than an incomplete product requirement.

Open work should be created only when one of these conditions is met:

- a reproducible runtime or evidence-faithfulness regression appears;
- a reviewer-facing demo cannot explain a core contract;
- a dependency, parser, ingest, or store-signature change requires new evidence;
- a real caller still depends on a compatibility path scheduled for removal.

## Next Work

The final README-first walkthrough is complete. The primary path now runs one
fixture-backed command and exposes semantic planning, hybrid retrieval,
deterministic calculation, provenance, task/artifact integrity, and critic
acceptance in a coherent trace. Optional cache and promotion surfaces are
separate deep-validation paths.

There is no planned broad cleanup phase. Open the next change only for a
reproducible regression, a concrete caller requirement, or a specific reviewer
explanation gap.

Do not start another broad refactor, proactive full benchmark, all-at-once test
split, new MAS capability, or cache-serving path without a concrete blocker.
Oversized tests are split only when their public contract is being changed.

## Session Handoff

A new session should read, in order:

1. [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
2. [CONTEXT.md](../../CONTEXT.md)
3. this document
4. `git status -sb`
5. `git log -5 --oneline`

Repository documents and Git history override ChatGPT/Codex memory for current
commits, blockers, benchmark results, API/model state, and artifact locations.
