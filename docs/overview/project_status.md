## At A Glance

| Question | Current answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is the product? | Single-agent `FinancialAgent` for evidence-backed DART filing analysis |
| Is the core path blocked? | No known unit/contract correctness blocker |
| What is the architecture state? | Phase 3 OPEN; direct structured lookup-row/value projection is lookup-recovery-owned, four named debt groups remain |
| What just changed? | Two direct structured-evidence seams totaling 220 old lines moved to `financial_lookup_recovery.py` in `5f9dc5c` |
| What passed? | Focused 4/4 per seam and combined 8/8, lookup owner 24/24, migrated operation contracts 4/4, affected seven-module semantic set 818/818, import-side-effect 19/19, runtime audit 217, full unittest 1,811/1,811 |
| Was the benchmark refreshed? | **NOT RUN**; recorded benchmark evidence predates the latest calculation changes |
| What is next? | One characterize-first 62-line own-evidence lookup-unit alignment seam into `financial_aggregate_projection.py`; peer-source callback binding, evidence preparation, rebuild/state mutation, ledger, and final sequencing remain hard stops |

## Product Boundary

The reviewer-facing product is the single-agent `FinancialAgent` runtime:

1. preserve DART section and table structure during ingest;
2. retrieve through dense/BM25 hybrid search and structure-aware expansion;
3. use an LLM for intent and semantic planning;
4. bind operands and execute calculations deterministically;
5. return evidence-backed answers with calculation and provenance traces.

MAS, report-cache promotion, evaluators, benchmark runners, and extended review
workflows are optional or experimental. They must not load during default imports
or an unconfigured `FinancialAgent` invocation.

## Current Source State

- PRs #79 through #84 completed the July portfolio-core simplification; PR #85
  compressed the earlier handoff documents. Latest confirmed upstream merge is
  `main@f0a5145`.
- The local checkpoint is the current HEAD of
  `codex/finalize-five-minute-review`; use `git log` for the exact commit. It is
  not represented here as pushed or merged.
- Canonical numeric output is `resolved_calculation_trace`, explicit
  `structured_result`, and task/artifact projection. Default output does not
  revive top-level `calculation_*` compatibility mirrors.
- Default import and deterministic invocation gates isolate MAS, evaluator,
  benchmark, promotion, portfolio-review, and persisted cache-index code.
- Tracked benchmark output remains limited to compact history-linked summaries
  and diagnostics. Full bundles, stores, caches, and heartbeat logs are local-only.
- An earlier two-seam owner batch moved prepared nested-result replacement and
  arithmetic subtask-surface synchronization. Across `6ed195e..b5d97ee`, the
  former 64 + 124 = 188 graph definition lines became public 63 + 123 = 186
  owner lines; all four selected calls remain graph-external and retired
  private refs are zero. Source is `+197/-204`, net `-7`; tests are
  `+1,569/-184`, net `+1,385`; the whole range is `+1,766/-388`, net `+1,378`.
  Calculation moved from 14,719 to 14,521 physical lines and aggregate
  projection from 3,350 to 3,541. The range source diff SHA-256 is
  `ee76d6ffa2c0e1f14e8dec7630a6f11e5f39ad4323e1ed5a23f07e6d0fbda1f8`.
  Graph state/evidence, dependency alignment, projection rebuild,
  artifact/ledger mutation, and final sequencing remain graph-owned. This is
  ownership relocation, not a behavior claim.
- Commit `b3bb764` moved the former 53-line
  `_recover_duplicate_growth_prior_operand(...)` body to one 52-line public
  `recover_duplicate_growth_prior_operand(...)` owner function. Its sole call
  remains graph-external in calculation-candidate preparation, after growth
  unit alignment and before the period-conflict gate. Source is `+56/-55`, net
  `+1`; tests are `+629/-26`, net `+603`; the whole commit is `+685/-81`, net
  `+604`. Calculation moved from 14,521 to 14,468 physical lines and aggregate
  projection from 3,541 to 3,595. Four new test methods moved discovery from
  1,789 to 1,793. The source diff SHA-256 is
  `1a02ec371d28b6012b064281260ad3b274bc9f1ef0b330d0724c36d545b56d1a`.
  Retired private refs are zero in source and tests. Candidate construction,
  unit/period alignment, execution, state/evidence, rebuild, artifact/ledger,
  and final sequencing remain graph-owned. This is ownership relocation, not a
  behavior claim.
- Commit `d31e67a` moved the former 48-line
  `_filter_final_aggregate_evidence_and_projection(...)` body to one 47-line
  public `filter_final_aggregate_evidence_and_projection(...)` owner function.
  Its two calls remain graph-external in aggregate orchestration, before the
  ordinary state sync/runtime-ratio repair and after conditional stale-state
  replacement respectively. Source is `+52/-53`, net `-1`; tests are
  `+646/-41`, net `+605`; the whole commit is `+698/-94`, net `+604`.
  Calculation moved from 14,468 to 14,418 physical lines and aggregate
  projection from 3,595 to 3,644. Four new test methods moved discovery from
  1,793 to 1,797. The source diff SHA-256 is
  `f10c327aca0fb5a4a885892354bef1b840caaf224a9696ae113c9d650df45df1`.
  Retired private refs are zero in source and tests. Evidence preparation,
  stale/runtime-ratio repair, state synchronization, answer composition,
  artifact/ledger mutation, and final sequencing remain graph-owned. This is
  ownership relocation, not a behavior claim.
- Commit `8861253` moved the former 310-line
  `_repair_collapsed_ratio_trace_from_evidence(...)` body to one 309-line public
  `repair_collapsed_ratio_trace_from_evidence(...)` runtime-trace function. Its
  two calls remain graph-external in `financial_graph.py`: one after a nonempty
  structured public projection and one before the separate period-comparison
  repair. Source is `+322/-315`, net `+7`; tests are `+1,574/-166`, net
  `+1,408`; the whole commit is `+1,896/-481`, net `+1,415`. Calculation moved
  from 14,418 to 14,106 physical lines, main graph from 937 to 938, and runtime
  trace from 1,094 to 1,412. Six new test methods moved discovery from 1,797 to
  1,803. The source diff SHA-256 is
  `a83d1ddaa2167516789bc9de1a90033dd7183d6764ddf0609bf91a777199e451`.
  Retired private refs are zero, the runtime-trace owner contains three public
  and 28 private top-level functions, and the reviewed runtime-domain count
  remains 217. Public-answer orchestration, period repair, retrieval/canonical
  evidence construction, mutable state/evidence, artifact/ledger mutation, and
  final sequencing remain graph-owned. This is ownership relocation, not a
  behavior claim.
- Commit `5f9dc5c` moved the former 81-line direct structured lookup-row and
  139-line direct structured operand-value bodies to public 80-line
  `lookup_row_from_direct_structured_evidence(...)` and 138-line
  `coerce_operand_value_from_direct_structured_evidence(...)` in
  `financial_lookup_recovery.py`. All five calls remain graph-external and the
  old private source/test refs are zero. Source is `+241/-229`, net `+12`;
  tests are `+1,229/-8`, net `+1,221`; the whole commit is `+1,470/-237`, net
  `+1,233`. Calculation moved from 14,106 to 13,887 physical lines and lookup
  recovery from 557 to 788. Eight new test methods moved discovery from 1,803
  to 1,811. The source diff SHA-256 is
  `c4b9c78f90715b4332b559159220e00e6f00d46d2912a4f982cdbabaf0fd271e`.
  The lookup owner contains 11 public and seven private top-level functions;
  the newly dead calculation `_structured_cell_period_text` import was removed
  and the reviewed runtime-domain count remains 217. Evidence-pool
  selection/scoring, state/report scope, table-label lookup, precision
  refinement, mutable evidence, artifact/ledger mutation, and final sequencing
  remain graph-owned. This is ownership relocation, not a behavior claim.
- Current physical sizes are: calculation graph 13,887 lines, main graph 938,
  graph helpers 6,269,
  planning 2,048, calculation rendering 708, answer slots 734, numeric surface
  670, answer projection 625, text surface 411, operand resolution 3,603,
  dependency projection 3,417, reconciliation 1,667, reconciliation candidates
  329, aggregate projection 3,644, runtime trace 1,412, lookup recovery 788,
  task artifacts 1,460, reflection projection
  374, and run projection 302.

[implementation_history.md](../history/implementation_history.md).

## Runtime Ownership

| Surface | Current owner and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Public entry | `FinancialAgent.run()` |
| DART ingest | parser modules plus canonical profile in `src/config/runtime_contract.py` |
| Retrieval | `financial_retrieval_pipeline.py`; graph evidence owns structure expansion and evidence construction |
| Calculation orchestration | `financial_graph_calculation.py`; reads graph state, prepares inputs, places owner calls, and projects state/task/artifact results |
| Operand policy and resolution | `financial_operand_resolution.py`, including ratio sign policy, evidence-local unit/period coercion, dependency-task KRW consistency, table-metadata/raw-unit repair, and growth alignment/period conflict |
| Dependency and execution | `financial_dependency_projection.py`, including dependency input matching/binding, sibling-output synthesis preference, sibling lookup-surface preparation, and resolved reconciliation projection, plus `financial_calculation_execution.py` |
| Lookup recovery | `financial_lookup_recovery.py`, including lookup magnitude/unit recovery, selected-evidence consistency/refinement, successful-row alignment/replacement, and direct structured lookup-row/value projection over already supplied evidence |
| Structured reconciliation candidates | `financial_reconciliation_candidates.py`; state-free statement/unit/period/score/identity/row/match and candidate-ID projection over already prepared mappings |
| Calculation rendering | `financial_graph_calculation_rendering.py`, including ratio unit/query/result projection and scalar/time-series display helpers |
| Answer and numeric surfaces | `financial_answer_slots.py`, `financial_answer_projection.py`, `financial_numeric_surface.py`, and `financial_text_surface.py`, including period/material, nested-row traversal/scoring/selected-result promotion, ratio-readiness, narrative validation, numeric/scale predicates, and shared sentence/token surfaces |
| Aggregate projection | `financial_aggregate_projection.py`, including aggregate calculation/public projection, subtask upsert/rank, selectors, dependency-source preparation, source/coherence preparation, result/nested ranks, stable dedupe, nested-result replacement, arithmetic subtask-surface synchronization, duplicate growth-prior recovery, final evidence/provenance projection, narrative row-focus/gap policy, lookup-answer surfaces, growth display/material projection, prepared growth-numeric rendering and trace inspection, result support/reuse predicates, prepared growth/ratio material inspection, final-answer evidence filtering/operand append/surface-operand projection, and growth-answer completion/sanitization |
| Composition, trace, artifacts | `financial_aggregate_state.py`, `financial_runtime_trace.py`, and `financial_task_artifacts.py`; runtime trace includes collapsed-ratio evidence repair and the task-artifact owner includes bounded reconciliation artifact refs, runtime-evidence merge, and ratio result-row projection, but neither owns ledger mutation orchestration |
| Caller-facing run projection | `financial_agent_run_projection.py`; state-free runtime-evidence metadata/citation, agent-answer/review/debug, structured missing-answer selection, aggregate completion, and prepared public-answer state projection, excluding evidence selection, dynamic answer/trace repair, graph execution, and final sequencing |
| Reflection projection | `financial_reflection_projection.py`; deterministic retry-query construction/finalization, action/report, synthesis-source, request/plan normalization, strict summaries, and bounded request construction are owner-held |
| Optional systems | `src.experimental.mas` and explicitly configured cache/eval/review paths |

For topology rather than normative behavior, use
[runtime_flow_roles.md](runtime_flow_roles.md).

## Current Gate Status

| Gate | Latest status |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime contract gate | Recorded PASS; upstream raw bundle local-only |
| Hard structural numeric gate | Recorded PASS, 5 / 5; upstream raw bundle local-only |
| Concept runtime gap gate | Recorded PASS, 7 / 7; upstream raw bundle local-only |
| Policy-driven runtime gate | Recorded PASS; upstream raw bundle local-only |
| Expanded structural numeric gate | Recorded PASS, 9 / 9; upstream raw bundle local-only |
| Plain-retrieval comparison | Recorded 5 / 9 diagnostic baseline; not synchronized after later repairs |
| Reflection promotion gate | READY |
| Report-cache promotion evidence | READY, serving disabled |
| Promotion trace materiality gate | READY |
| REFERENCE_NOTE capability gate | READY, Researcher context-only |
| Demo fixture contract | `fixture_contract_ready`; manifest verified, live replay false |
| Portfolio review surface | `review_surface_ready`; unit suite and audit are `not_run` by that command |
| Latest focused owner checkpoint | PASS, direct structured lookup-row 4 / 4, operand-value 4 / 4, combined 8 / 8; lookup owner 24 / 24; migrated operation contracts 4 / 4 |
| Latest semantic regression set | PASS, affected seven-module set 818 / 818; semantic/import union 837 / 837 |
| Import-side-effect regression set | PASS, 19 / 19 |
| Runtime domain-term audit | PASS, 217 reviewed literals |
| Full unittest discovery | PASS, 1,811 / 1,811 |
| Benchmark refresh after latest calculation changes | **NOT RUN** |
| GitHub Actions validation | Workflow defined; no remote run claimed for this local branch |

The semantic set is `tests.test_lookup_recovery_policy`,
`tests.test_financial_calculation_execution`, `tests.test_financial_operand_resolution`,
`tests.test_aggregate_subtask_projection`, `tests.test_subtask_loop`,
`tests.test_financial_agent_run_projection`, and `tests.test_operation_contracts`.
`tests.test_import_side_effects` passed separately at 19 / 19 and together with
the semantic set as an 837-test union.

Recorded structural and plain-retrieval numbers are historical evidence, not a
claim that the latest owner changes reran a paid benchmark. Their upstream raw
bundles are not checked in and are not independently reproducible from this
checkout. A fresh benchmark is required before publishing a new score after a
material parser, ingest, store-signature, retrieval, or answer-contract change.

## Active Blockers And Remaining Debt

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Core correctness | No known unit/contract blocker |
| Latest benchmark evidence | Limited: refresh not run after the latest calculation changes |
| Phase 3 | Open; owner moves do not establish an end-to-end calculation or ledger owner |
| Optional MAS/cache serving | Intentionally disabled or experimental, not a product blocker |

The durable Phase 3 debt is:

| Debt group | Progress boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Aggregate repair and precedence | Partially advanced through aggregate calculation/public projection, subtask upsert/rank, nested traversal/scoring/selected-result promotion, nested-result replacement, arithmetic subtask-surface synchronization, period/material/source/coherence/rank/dedupe, narrative validation, growth display/material, prepared growth-numeric rendering and trace inspection, result support/reuse, prepared material inspection, bounded row/gap/lookup-answer ownership, final-answer evidence/provenance/surface-operand projection, and growth-answer completion/sanitization; broader alignment/rebuild and final sequencing remain graph-owned |
| Dependency and ratio/absolute seams | Partially advanced through ratio presentation/readiness/scale, bounded operand preparation, lookup magnitude, same-block unit/table repair, direct structured lookup-row/value projection, and dependency input matching/binding; graph-state lookup, broader evidence orchestration, and surrounding sequencing remain graph-owned |
| Broader task/artifact ledger synchronization | Minimally advanced through bounded read-only reconciliation artifact-reference projection; artifact mutation and whole-ledger synchronization require separate contracts |
| Private API mesh and test co-location | Partially advanced as public contracts move |

These are debt groups, not a promised count of four implementation slices. Each
may split or close only after caller, test, and stop-line characterization.

## Next Work

The sole selected architecture work is one characterize-first lookup-unit
alignment seam from `financial_graph_calculation.py` into the existing
`financial_aggregate_projection.py` owner. Move the current graph-private
`_align_lookup_result_units_from_own_evidence(ordered_results, evidence_items)`
definition (62 lines) as public
`align_lookup_result_units_from_own_evidence(ordered_results, evidence_items)`
(projected 61 lines). Delete the old body and retarget both direct calls; add no
wrapper, alias, callback, carrier, reason, flag, or output field. Both calls
remain graph-external, positional, and outside `try` blocks. The first stays in
`_collect_initial_aggregate_evidence_state(...)` immediately before peer-source
unit alignment and the equality-gated dedupe/rebuild path. The second stays in
`_aggregate_calculation_subtasks(...)` after missing-context evidence adoption
and immediately before the same peer-source alignment and late replacement
path. The aggregate owner moves from public/private 74/11 to 75/11.

Preserve evidence-ID indexing and its empty-evidence identity return; row order;
explicit operation-family precedence with owner-local aggregate-family
fallback; lookup/single-value, primary-slot material, raw-value, evidence,
coerced-unit, unchanged-unit, and normalized-value gates; evidence-local unit
coercion; source-ID cleanup; exact updated primary-slot fields and marker;
`replace_lookup_primary_slot(...)` adoption; unchanged-row alias identity;
original-list identity when no row changes; a fresh list only when at least one
row changes; nested alias identity; input/evidence immutability; access
laziness; and all uncaught exceptions.

The aggregate owner already imports `answer_slot_has_material`, normalization,
operand resolution, and dependency projection, and already owns
`aggregate_result_operation_family(...)`. Add only
`_evidence_items_by_id`, `_evidence_item_for_operand_row`, and
`coerce_operand_unit_from_evidence` on the existing operand-resolution edge,
plus `lookup_primary_slot` and `replace_lookup_primary_slot` on the existing
dependency-projection edge. No module edge is added, neither dependency reaches
the aggregate owner, and the move is acyclic. The calculation imports
`lookup_primary_slot` and `replace_lookup_primary_slot` become dead and must be
deleted; every other moved-body dependency import remains live elsewhere. The
selected span contains no reviewed runtime-domain record, so the audit count
remains 217.

Before production moves, add exactly four CURRENT-SOURCE methods to
`tests.test_financial_aggregate_rank_dedupe`: two direct branch/access/laziness/
copy/identity/order/no-mutation/exception matrices, one exact 62-line/two-call/
signature/try-depth/DAG/baseline/dead-import inventory, and one executable combined caller
test fixing exact argument identity, placement, adoption/equality gates, peer
alignment handoff, and exception stop. Hold production until focused 4/4 is
independently green. After the literal move, retarget direct tests to the owner,
runtime caller patches to the imported graph symbol, and the four existing
private invocations in `tests.test_subtask_loop`; require retired private
source/test refs to reach zero.

Projected final gates are focused 4/4, aggregate owner 88/88, affected
seven-module semantic 882/882, import-side-effect 19/19, semantic/import union
901/901, runtime audit 217, full discovery 1,815/1,815, pycompile/fresh import,
DAG/body/caller parity, retired-ref zero, and diff check. The semantic set is
`tests.test_financial_aggregate_rank_dedupe`,
`tests.test_financial_calculation_execution`, `tests.test_financial_operand_resolution`,
`tests.test_aggregate_subtask_projection`, `tests.test_subtask_loop`,
`tests.test_financial_agent_run_projection`, and `tests.test_operation_contracts`.

Keep evidence collection and missing-context append, dedupe, projection rebuild,
dependency alignment, answer refresh, mutable state/evidence replacement,
artifact/ledger mutation, and final sequencing in the graph. Keep
`_align_lookup_result_units_from_peer_source_slots(...)` graph-owned because it
passes the dynamic `_aggregate_result_operation_family` callback into the
dependency owner; moving it would silently remove the compatibility/dispatch
seam. Continue to reject table-label lookup with its `_slot_metric_keys`
callback, graph-helper relocation, precision/carrier and ontology compatibility
clusters, prepared-candidate and compact-ratio state carriers, and state/ledger
expansions. No behavior, accuracy, ranking, performance, total-code or
executed-path reduction, benchmark, schedule, or Phase 3 completion claim
follows.

Priority is owned by this section. The durable plan records debt and stop lines,
not a competing queue.
