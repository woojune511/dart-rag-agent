# Core Runtime Surface Refactoring Plan

Last revised: 2026-07-22

This is the current execution plan for reducing repository complexity while
preserving the verified financial QA behavior. Git history and
`docs/overview/project_status.md` retain the detailed history of earlier
extraction PRs; this document describes the remaining direction and stop lines.

`docs/architecture/agent_runtime_contract.md` remains authoritative for runtime
behavior. Update both documents if a structural change alters that contract.

## Portfolio outcome

The repository should communicate one product claim:

> Retrieve numeric evidence from DART filings, use an LLM to plan the required
> calculation, execute it deterministically, and return a provenance-validated
> answer with an inspectable trace.

The default path should be understandable in about ten minutes:

```text
main.py -> financial_router.py -> FinancialAgent.run()
  -> semantic plan
  -> hybrid retrieval and structural rerank
  -> evidence and operand binding
  -> deterministic formula execution
  -> answer, structured_result, resolved_calculation_trace
```

Multi-agent orchestration is an experiment around this runtime. It is not the
default product engine and must not dominate reviewer-facing documentation.

## Surface classification

### Core

Core code is required by the default user path:

- FastAPI boundary and `FinancialAgent.run()` facade
- DART parsing, chunking, and structural metadata
- embedding configuration, Chroma, BM25, and structure storage
- query planning, retrieval, reranking, evidence selection, and reconciliation
- operand binding, deterministic execution, rendering, and verification
- `answer_slots`, `structured_result`, `resolved_calculation_trace`, citations,
  and `retrieval_debug_trace`
- ontology, retrieval policy, and runtime config consumed by those paths

Core runtime code may not import evaluator, benchmark, portfolio-review, MAS,
or cache-promotion implementations.

### Evaluation

Evaluation proves core behavior but is not part of request execution:

- evaluator and benchmark runner
- focused profiles and regression fixtures
- portfolio and capability gates
- experiment reports and reproducibility logs

Evaluation may consume public core contracts. Core must never depend on
evaluation normalization or score rules.

### Experimental and internal

These surfaces remain opt-in and outside the default product story:

- `src/experimental/mas/`
- disabled query-time graph-expansion variants
- report-cache and reflection promotion workflows
- diagnostic probes, smoke commands, and retrospective scripts

Keep an explicit import boundary. A feature that is disabled by default does
not justify extra state fields or imports in the core request path unless the
runtime contract requires them.

### Legacy compatibility

Legacy code includes old import paths, flat response mirrors, stale aliases,
callerless wrappers, and test-only production helpers. It is temporary, not a
fourth architecture layer.

Every compatibility surface must have:

1. a known caller;
2. a canonical replacement;
3. a removal condition;
4. a contract test only when external compatibility is still required.

If no caller remains, delete the surface and its private-helper-only test in the
same change.

## Refactoring rules

1. Preserve behavior before changing behavior. Do not mix owner extraction with
   retrieval tuning or benchmark repair.
2. Move implementation to an actual owner. A new facade that merely adds
   another forwarding layer is not progress.
3. Delete duplicated or callerless surfaces after migration. File splitting
   without caller migration does not reduce the conceptual surface.
4. Keep one canonical answer and calculation trace. Compatibility mirrors may
   read from them but may not override them.
5. Keep domain vocabulary in ontology, policy, config, or documented data.
6. Keep LLM semantics separate from deterministic execution and validation.
7. Keep benchmark artifacts, local stores, and caches out of source changes.

## Execution sequence

### Phase 0: Correctness prerequisites

Status: completed on 2026-07-22.

Close correctness gaps that would be hidden by structural work:

- numeric evidence equivalence must preserve sign;
- final-answer numeric backfill must select provenance using value, label, and
  period compatibility rather than numeric equality and list order alone.

Required proof: small contract tests, runtime-domain-term audit, and full unit
test discovery. No fresh benchmark ingest is required for these projection-only
changes.

### Phase 1: Reviewer-facing repositioning

Status: completed on 2026-07-22 for README, portfolio one-pager, project status,
and this execution plan. Follow-up reviewer documents should adopt the same
boundary when they are next touched.

- Make `DART Financial Agentic RAG` the primary name and story.
- Show the single-agent pipeline before optional capabilities.
- Keep the first-read path to README, one-pager, one trace walkthrough, one
  experiment report, and technical highlights.
- Move MAS, cache promotion, reflection promotion, and internal gates to an
  optional/experimental section.
- State benchmark limitations next to quantitative claims.

Completion condition: a reviewer can identify the problem, core pipeline,
representative result, and demo command without reading internal status logs.

### Phase 2: Give retrieval one owner

Status: completed on 2026-07-22 as a no-behavior-change owner extraction.

- `_retrieve`, query/filter construction, reranking, candidate selection, and
  trace projection now live in `financial_retrieval_pipeline.py`.
- Retrieval-only module helpers moved with the implementation; evidence imports
  only the shared lookup/evidence helpers it still consumes.
- `FinancialAgentEvidenceMixin` no longer defines `_retrieve` or reranking.
- Focused owner/scope/query/import tests cover the new boundary.
- Full unittest discovery passes with `1349` tests.

Create `src/agent/financial_retrieval_pipeline.py` as the implementation owner
for:

- retrieval query bundle assembly;
- metadata filter construction;
- dense/BM25 execution and reuse;
- deterministic structural reranking;
- visible and seed candidate selection;
- `retrieval_debug_trace` construction.

`financial_graph_evidence.py` should retain evidence construction, evidence
preservation, narrative support, and final evidence validation. Its `_retrieve`
node may delegate to the retrieval owner, but it must not keep a second copy of
the pipeline.

Completion conditions:

- one retrieval implementation owner;
- unchanged graph node contract and debug trace schema;
- focused retrieval tests import or exercise the new owner;
- no retrieval behavior tuning in the extraction change;
- old implementation deleted after caller migration.

### Phase 3: Converge on one calculation path

Status: next after draft PR #79. Start with the public API projection boundary;
do not begin by splitting calculation helpers by file size.

First slice:

- owner: `src/api/financial_router.py::_query_response_from_agent_result`;
- when `agent_answer` is present, treat it as the canonical projection and
  preserve intentional empty strings, lists, and dictionaries;
- use legacy flat result fields only when `agent_answer` itself is absent;
- add the regression contract to `tests/test_financial_router_response.py`;
- keep retrieval, formula execution, and answer-generation behavior unchanged.

Required proof for this slice: the focused router response tests, full unit
test discovery, and `git diff --check`. A benchmark refresh is not required for
this API-only compatibility change.

The canonical path is:

```text
OperandResolver -> FormulaExecutor -> AnswerRenderer -> Verifier
```

Use existing owner modules before adding new ones:

- `financial_answer_slots.py`
- `financial_calculation_execution.py`
- `financial_graph_calculation_rendering.py`
- `financial_runtime_trace.py`
- `financial_answer_projection.py`

Continue work in `financial_graph_calculation.py` only for a concrete caller
migration, contract gap, or bug. Each extraction must move callers and delete
the old implementation. Do not split the file merely to reduce line count.

Completion conditions:

- one source of truth for operands, formula result, and rendered answer;
- legacy flat mirrors cannot override `agent_answer` or the resolved trace;
- wrappers with no runtime caller are removed;
- tests are organized by operand, execution, rendering, verification, and
  projection contracts rather than private helper location.

### Phase 4: Isolate optional systems

- Default runtime imports must not load MAS, evaluator, benchmark, cache
  promotion, or portfolio-review implementations.
- New MAS callers use `src.experimental.mas`; legacy `src.agent` MAS imports
  remain only while a verified external caller requires them.
- Candidate-only cache and promotion gates remain evaluation/internal surfaces
  until a separate product requirement enables them.
- Debug and review bundles are opt-in at API boundaries.

Completion condition: importing and invoking the default runtime does not load
optional systems, while their focused tests still pass independently.

### Phase 5: Reduce review and test noise

- Split oversized test files by public contract when touching the relevant
  behavior; do not perform an all-at-once test rewrite.
- Keep only representative published benchmark evidence: one structural
  full-system result, one plain comparison, and a small failure fixture set.
- Keep full local result bundles, stores, caches, and heartbeat logs untracked.
- Prefer current architecture docs over chronological implementation diaries.

Completion condition: reviewer-facing docs link to a small evidence set, while
internal history remains available without defining the product surface.

## Deletion criteria

Before deleting or archiving a module, answer:

1. Is it required by `FinancialAgent.run()`?
2. Is it required by `FinancialParser.process_document()`?
3. Is it required by `VectorStoreManager.search()` or canonical ingest?
4. Is it required to create `structured_result` or
   `resolved_calculation_trace`?
5. Is it required by README quick-review commands?
6. Is it current evidence for a reviewer-facing claim?
7. Does a real external caller still use its compatibility path?

If every answer is no, delete it. If an answer is yes, move it to the correct
surface or preserve a narrow adapter with a named removal condition.

## Verification order

For every phase:

1. run the smallest owner/contract tests;
2. for changes under `src/agent` or `src/routing`, run
   `python -m src.ops.audit_runtime_domain_terms`;
3. run `python -m unittest discover -s tests`;
4. run `portfolio_review_gates` when reviewer-facing behavior changes;
5. use a focused store-fixed eval-only benchmark only when runtime behavior may
   affect answer quality;
6. run a full benchmark only with known store/cache inputs and heartbeat logs.

Always check `git diff --check` and artifact hygiene before handoff.

## Stop lines

Stop and reassess when:

- an extraction creates a new forwarding layer without moving callers;
- a deletion requires weakening a public contract;
- a runtime rule needs company, benchmark, or metric-specific vocabulary;
- evidence faithfulness decreases to improve a score;
- optional systems still leak into the default import path;
- a long benchmark has neither results nor a heartbeat;
- experimental artifacts would need to be committed without explicit approval.
